# EPISD Crackers
# **IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO THIS REPO: FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY PLEASE CREATE AN ALT OR A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT**
## Who are we? Your secret benefactors (okay that sounds like a movie villain)! No, but actually we want to make the computers of EPISD more secure (free from iBoss and JAMF spyware and censorship) because for some people, these are the only computers they have. What is the whole point of a computer if you can't use it freely?
##### * we actually don't condone doing anything illegal or immoral of course, EPISD admins, we mean no harm or headache to you, just let us game in peace okay? This repo is mostly to cripple iBoss and Jamf because it *sometimes* gets in the way of legitimate school work.
## This repo  contains scripts, guides, and examples to make your computer more free, as in freedom.
